Hi, i'm @gorandakov.
My name is Goran Dakov and my legal birth date is 11/01/1983 but my real birth date is 17/01/1983.
I'm something in between a disabled person on benefits and someone who does some research and writes a own architecture CPU.
I am told one person cannot on their own write and debug a OoO cpu so if nobody helps it'll stay not fully debugged which is fine.
